Simple recipe website

The project's goal is to create a website that has a home page that links 
to a few recipe pages. This will be a barebones website, but will allow 
for HTML practice. The site will be improved using CSS in the future.

Some skills that I should demonstrate in this project:
	- Use of image and hyperlinks
	- Use of lists
	- Bolds and Italics
	- Use of GIT and pushing to GITHUB (including commit msgs)
